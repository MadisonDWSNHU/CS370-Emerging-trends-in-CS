For this project, I focused on developing the code for the main loop of the application. This code was crucial as it controlled the agent’s decision-making process, determining whether the agent should explore new decisions or use what it already knows.  
The main loop formed the backbone of the application’s decision-making system, and my contribution directly influenced the agent’s behavior and overall performance. While some foundational code was provided, I created the logic for this functionality, 
enabling the agent to adapt dynamically to varying scenarios.

There are many connections to the field of computer science in this project and how computer scientists solve problems/contribute to the world. When approaching problems as a computer scientist, my process typically begins with observing the problem and 
coming up with several ways I can go about solving the problem, then narrowing my ideas down to one viable solution. I then start on creating my work and periodically testing it, changing my idea if needed. In the context of computer science, this
often involves designing, implementing, and refining algorithms to solve problems efficiently and effectively.

Ethics is an important thing in the industry and appears here in thhis project. A primary responsibility to the end user is to maintain transparency. This includes being open about how systems function, particularly in machine learning applications. 
Transparency may involve identifying and addressing potential biases in the system and clearly sharing information about the data sources used for training. Such efforts help build trust with users and ensure that the technology is both fair and reliable. 
For the organization, my ethical duty is to uphold integrity by ensuring that the systems I develop align with organizational goals while safeguarding the rights and privacy of all users in the process.

Through this project, I not only enhanced my technical abilities but also gained a deeper understanding of the problem-solving approaches and ethical responsibilities that define the role of a computer scientist, and I can use these skills later for the development 
of new processes, especially AI.
